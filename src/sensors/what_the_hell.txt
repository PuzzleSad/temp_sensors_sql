What the hell is this s_vtable business??????

The strange method of coding in the sensors section of the program is an exercise.
At the time of writing I don't have a clear idea of how polymorphism is implemented for languages 
such as cpp. 
The exercise is to force myself to implement a solution with limited knowledge of what is done 
in a language such as cpp. 

The idea is that there is a compatability layer implemented. 
Since various temperature sensors will have different ways to talk to them, in order to write a 
program to talk to these various sensors, each one would need a special section of code to be 
accessed.
